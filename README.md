<h3>Implementing speech synthesis(ðŸ“– to ðŸ—£) on eBooks</h3>

Bored of writing notes in a lecture? How about we convert the notes dictated by the lecturer into text?
Use the **speechtotext.py** script to get the text format of spoken notes, which saves the text in a .txt file.
<br>
Too lazy to read a novel? Get an Ebook version of the novel and run the **finalAudioBookGenerator.py** script. It will generate an mp3(audio) format of the book. Enjoy book listening :)
<br>
You can also convert your single images using **singleImageReader.py** script
<br><br>
An **example** of each of the script is shown, the text from **_spoken text.PNG_** was delivered by me, observe the **s2txt.txt** it is the output (accurate to a great extent if you have a decent english speaking accent)<br>
Listen to the **read.mp3** and observe the page numbers which are spoken from the pdf file. (eg of ebook reader)
