Room r1=new Room();
 
                      
R1.getdata(20,10);
 
                    
area=r1.length*r1.breadth;
 
                    

 
            
}
 
}  
 
 
Output:
-
 
Area=200.0

Algorithm
: 
 
 
1.
 
Start.
 
2.
 
Declare a class named Circle.
 
3.
 
Initialize the required variables.
 
4.
 
Declare a method getdata() and get value of radius from main function as a 
parameter.
 
5.
 
Declare a method area to calculate the area of circle and display the result.
 
6.
 
Declare main() and create object of class Circle. And access the methods with 
the help of object.
 
7.
 
Display the area.
 
8.
 
Stop. 
 
 
7.
 
Conclusion:
 
After performing this experiment we are able to 
create a 
class and object
. The 
classes 
are interacting with each other by accessing the methods and members
 
of class 
using different objects.
 
 
8.
 
Viva Questions: 
 

 
What is 
class and 
object?
 
How to access class using object?
 

 
How two objects communicate?
