Experiment No.4
 
1.
 
Aim:
 
Write a program to create a Rectangle class, objects, and implement method 
to 
calculate area of rectangle.
 
 
2.
 
Objectives: 
From this experiment, the student will be able to 
 

 
Understand basics of Object Oriented programming
 

 
To solve the real world scenarios using top down approach. 
 
 
3.
 
Outcomes: 
The learner will be able to
 
 

 
Understand 
how to model the real world scenario using class
es and object.
 
 

 
Exhibit comm
unication between objects of different classes.
 
4.
 
Hardware / Software Required :
 
Ubuntu, Java
 
 
5.
 
Theory:  
 
Objects are the basic runtime entities in an object oriented system. A class 
may be 

code of the class are accessed by object of that class.
 
 
In this program, the object of class circle is used to access the methods: 
getdata() & 
area() of this cl
ass.
 
Syntax:
-
     
 
         
class Class_Name
 
               
{
 
                    
public static void main(String args[]) 
 
                     
{
 
                                  
// Statements;
 
                      
}
 
               
}
 
 
     
 
For example:
-
 
 
class Room
 
               
{
 
                   
float length;
 
                    
float breadth;
 
                    
void getdata(float a, float b)
 
                    
{
 
                        
length=a;
 
                        
breadth=b;
 
                 
  
}
 
                  
public static void main(String args[])
 
                  
{
 
                     
float area;
 
 
32
 
 
                      
Room r1=new Room();
 
                      
R1.getdata(20,10);
 
                    
area=r1.length*r1.breadth;
 
                    

 
            
}
 
}  
 
 
Output:
-
 
Area=200.0

Algorithm
: 
 
 
1.
 
Start.
 
2.
 
Declare a class named Circle.
 
3.
 
Initialize the required variables.
 
4.
 
Declare a method getdata() and get value of radius from main function as a 
parameter.
 
5.
 
Declare a method area to calculate the area of circle and display the result.
 
6.
 
Declare main() and create object of class Circle. And access the methods with 
the help of object.
 
7.
 
Display the area.
 
8.
 
Stop. 
 
 
7.
 
Conclusion:
 
After performing this experiment we are able to 
create a 
class and object
. The 
classes 
are interacting with each other by accessing the methods and members
 
of class 
using different objects.
 
 
8.
 
Viva Questions: 
 

 
What is 
class and 
object?
 
How to access class using object?
 

 
How two objects communicate?
